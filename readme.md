## 1️⃣ Python for AI

Python is the most popular language in AI due to its readability and powerful libraries.

**Topics:**
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Functions and Modules
- File Handling and Input/Output
- OOP Basics

**Example:**
```python
print("AI with Python")
2️⃣ NumPy for AI
NumPy (Numerical Python) is used for handling arrays and matrix computations.

Topics:

Arrays: np.array(), np.zeros(), np.ones()

Shape and Reshape

Slicing and Indexing

Math Operations: np.sum(), np.mean()

Matrix: np.dot(), np.transpose()

Example:

python
